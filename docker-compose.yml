      **Fapello Downloader** is a simple web application that lets you batch
      download all images and videos from any public Fapello.com profile.  Just
      paste a Fapello page URL and the downloader will fetch every media file
      into a zip archive for you.  This containerised version exposes a web
      interface on port 8089 and stores downloaded data in
      `/DATA/AppData/FapelloDownloader/data` on the host.
